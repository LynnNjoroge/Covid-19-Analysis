# Covid-19-Analysis

### Introduction

This project seeks to analyze the spread of Covid-19 throughout the World, in Africa and in Kenya.
Specifically, it seeks to analyse the impact of relaxation of covid-19 safety measures that took place in September, 2020 in Kenya.

### Motivation

COVID-19 is currently recognized as the world's most viral and severe pandemic spread in the last twenty years, as compared to Ebola 2014, MERS 2012, and SARS 2003. 
Seeing as we are still in the middle of the outbreak, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of COVID-19 worlwide and in our own backyard.

### Summary of Analysis

From the analysis, we can see that the virus has spread to all parts of the world as shown below.

From the analysis we can see that every continent has recorded many cases of the virus, with Europe and North america haveing the highest number of cases.
as of December,2020, the continental cases are as follows: 

1. Europe        24,342,666
2. North America	23,665,598
3. Asia	          20,106,747
4. South America	13,320,726
5. Africa	        2,830,285
6. Oceania	      31,557

From the analysis, we can also see that the virus has made its way to all African countries as shown below by the map and by the bar chart.

In September, the President of Kenya, President Uhuru Kenyatta, relaxed COVID-19 Measures in place by extending the curfew to last from 11PM to 4AM instead of the original 9PM to 5PM. Additionally, he lifted a ban on the sale of alcohol in restaurants and bars which saw these business reopen. the graph below shows the effect of these decisions:

From the analysis we can see that after the Covid-19 safety measures were relaxed in September, 2020, there has been a significant increase in new cases, total cases and deaths. Therefore, we can conclude that the relaxation of these measures has impacted Kenya negatively.
